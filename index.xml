This blog is intended to document my journey through the world of data science/bioinformatics/programming/machine learning/text mining/*insert cool topic here*.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Biotechnologist by degree but have been since converted to the tech world thanks to my (currently ongoing) PhD in Bioinformatics, in which I work with gene co-expression networks and develop the R package CEMiTool.
I&amp;rsquo;m also very interested in videogames, music and languages, and more often than not these topics will be the subject of my analyses on the site.</description>
